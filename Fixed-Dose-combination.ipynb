Fingolimod is currently being studied for the treatment of COVID-19, the disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Regardless, temazepam has become one of the most frequently prescribed medications internationally and sees millions of prescriptions every year. Unfortunately, however, given its frequent use and the inherent nature of its pharmacological effects, temazepam - like many other benzodiazepines - possesses a high potential for misuse and is genuinely capable of developing drug tolerance, physical dependence, and addiction in users.\\n\",\n",

       " 'Levothyroxine is a synthetically produced form of thyroxine, a major endogenous hormone secreted by the thyroid gland.14 Also known as L-thyroxine or the brand name product Synthroid, levothyroxine is used primarily to treat hypothyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland is no longer able to produce sufficient quantities of the thyroid hormones T4 (tetraiodothyronine or thyroxine) and T3 (triiodothyronine or Liothyronine), resulting in diminished down-stream effects of these hormones. Without sufficient quantities of circulating thyroid hormones, symptoms of hypothyroidism begin to develop such as fatigue, increased heart rate, depression4, dry skin and hair, muscle cramps, constipation, weight gain, memory impairment, and poor tolerance to cold temperatures.15,10\\nIn response to Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) release by the pituitary gland, a normally functioning thyroid gland will produce and secrete T4, which is then converted through deiodination (by type I or type II 5′-deiodinases)8 into its active metabolite T3. While T4 is the major product secreted by the thyroid gland, T3 exerts the majority of the physiological effects of the thyroid hormones; T4 and T3 have a relative potency of ~1:4 (T4:T3).14 T4 and T3 act on nearly every cell of the body, but have a particularly strong effect on the cardiac system.6 As a result, many cardiac functions including heart rate, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance are closely linked to thyroid status.7\\nPrior to the development of levothyroxine, Thyroid, porcine or desiccated thyroid, used to be the mainstay of treatment for hypothyroidism. However, this is no longer recommended for the majority of patients due to several clinical concerns including limited controlled trials supporting its use. Desiccated thyroid products contain a ratio of T4 to T3 of 4.2:1, which is significantly lower than the 14:1 ratio of secretion by the human thyroid gland. This higher proportion of T3 in desiccated thyroid products can lead to supraphysiologic levels of T3 which may put patients at risk of thyrotoxicosis if thyroid extract therapy is not adjusted according to the serum TSH.10,15\\n']"
